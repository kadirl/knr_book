# K&R C Book Exercises

This repository is my personal journey through **"The C Programming Language"** by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie. Here, I'm reading through the book and working on the exercises as I go. The goal is to deepen my understanding of C.

> **Note:** This is still a work in progress. I am adding solutions and notes as I make my way through the chapters.


## Overview

- **Exercise Solutions:** My answers to the exercises from each chapter of the K&R book.
- **Source Code:** C files for each exercise, with comments and explanations where needed.
- **Notes:** Occasional notes or observations.


## How to Use

1. **Browse the Code:** Check out the folders and files to see solutions for each chapter and exercise.
2. **Run the Programs:** You can compile any `.c` file using a C compiler like `gcc`. For example:
   ```
   gcc -o exercise1-1 exercise1-1.c
   ./exercise1-1
   ```
3. **Learn Along:** Feel free to look through my solution but don't use them as references, as they are far from perfect.


## Repository Structure

- Each exercise is typically in its own `.c` file.
- Additional folders or files may appear as I experiment or take notes.
